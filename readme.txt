Add enhanced Features for YITH Multi Vendor. (Ask us about extending other multi-vendor plugins.)

== Description ==

**Advanced Control of the Vendor Experience When Adding or Editing Their Products**

* Can define default values for all fields in a product when it is being added by a vendor.  This uses a Vendor Master Product where you can specify initial values for any fields in a product, including all postmeta and terms.
* Can hide any arbitrary content when a vendor is adding or editing a product so that they cannot modify or see fields that you do not want them to see or modify.
* Ability to rename almost every field when a vendor is adding or editing a product to make them more meaningful to the vendor.
* Ability to add help information to almost all areas on the page when a vendor is adding or editing a product.
* Ability to add detailed instructions for the vendor at the top of the page when the vendor is adding a product.

**Other 3rd Party Plugin Support**

* Works with "Offers for WooCommerce" by Angell EYE to permit vendors to let customers submit offers for their products.
* Lets the store owner define default values and/or hide postmeta and terms used by other 3rd party plugins from the vendor when the vendor is adding or editing a product.

**General Features**

* Can completely hide the identity of the vendor from the customer and the customer from the vendor.
* Can simplify the "Become a Vendor" form for registered users so that it relies on information already known as part of the registration process.
* Adds links to the users storefront account area for consigning and managing their own products.
* Can permit or prohibit the store owner from being able to see and manage vendors' offers.
* Expanded control over hiding or renaming admin menu items that the vendor sees when they are in the store admin.
